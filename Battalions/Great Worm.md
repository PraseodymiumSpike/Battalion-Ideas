# Great Worm
## Preface
This is adapted from an still-untested Ordamirror variant that I made a while ago which can be found [here](https://praseodymiumspike.neocities.org/Snake_in_Ordamirror). However, it is so different from that variant that I think it's reasonable to have it be my "brand-new" Battalion for this event. The idea of having the entire Battalion be a single monstrous creature is taken from Mad Chess, and some Piece abilities are inspired by the Pieces from that game as well.
## Pieces
### Worm Titan
Titan, Immutable, Moves and Captures up to 3 Spaces along Rook Lines, has properties listed below

The Boundless: causes the Player Controlling it to lose the game immediately if it visits or passes through a Square it has already been on or passed through previously at any point in the game even if this would fulfill a victory condition such as Checkmate

The Looming: must Move or Capture as an additional mandatory action that occurs at the end of its Controller's Turn, cannot Move or Capture otherwise except through its ability "The Contemptuous"

The Contemptuous: begins the game with 10 Contempt, increases its Contempt by 1 each time it takes its mandatory action to a maximum of 10, can spend 10 of its Contempt to Move or Capture outside of its mandatory action as long as that would leave it with a nonnegative amount of Contempt

The Nightmarish: as a turn, can spend 10 of its Contempt to create a Friendly Leg adjacent to a Lair in its Controller's Territory as long as that would leave it with a nonnegative amount of Contempt
