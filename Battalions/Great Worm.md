# Great Worm
## Preface
This is adapted from an still-untested Ordamirror variant that I made a while ago which can be found [here](https://praseodymiumspike.neocities.org/Snake_in_Ordamirror). However, it is so different from that variant that I think it's reasonable to have it be my "brand-new" Battalion for this event. The idea of having the entire Battalion be a single monstrous creature is taken from Mad Chess, and some Piece abilities are inspired by the Pieces from that game as well.
## Pieces
### Worm Titan
Titan, Immutable, Moves and Captures an unlimited number of Spaces along Rook Lines, has properties listed below

The Boundless: causes the Player Controlling it to lose the game immediately if it visits or passes through a Square it has already been on or passed through previously at any point in the game even if this would fulfill a victory condition such as Checkmate, cannot visit or pass through a Square it has already been on or passed through previously at any point in the game if this would Capture a Titan

The Looming: must Move or Capture as an additional mandatory action that occurs at the end of its Controller's Turn, cannot Move or Capture otherwise

The Nightmarish: begins the game with 9 Contempt, increases its Contempt by 1 each time it takes its mandatory action to a maximum of 9, designates the Space it starts on as a Lair during Territory Placement, can spend 9 of its Contempt as a regular Turn before its mandatory action that Turn in order to create a Friendly Leg on a Space adjacent to a Lair in its Controller's Territory as long as that would leave it with a nonnegative amount of Contempt
