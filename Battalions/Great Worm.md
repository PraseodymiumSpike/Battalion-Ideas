# Great Worm
## Preface
This is adapted from an still-untested Ordamirror variant that I made a while ago which can be found [here](https://praseodymiumspike.neocities.org/Snake_in_Ordamirror). However, it is so different from that variant that I think it's reasonable to have it be my "brand-new" Battalion for this event. The idea of having the entire Battalion be a single monstrous creature is taken from Mad Chess, and some Piece abilities are inspired by the Pieces from that game as well.
## Pieces

## Special Ability
A Lair is a Square that a Worm Titan starts the game on. When a Player moves their Worm Titan, they can additionally create a Friendly Leg on an empty Square adjacent to a Lair in their Territory. Here, "empty" should be taken to mean a Square on which it would be legal to drop a Friendly Piece from Hand. This ability can only be used if the Player using it didn't use it on any of their last 9 Turns or if they didn't ever use it in the game yet. The Leg is added to the Board immediately after the Worm Titan Moves or Captures.
