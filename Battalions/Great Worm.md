# Great Worm
## Preface
This is adapted from an still-untested Ordamirror variant that I made a while ago which can be found [here](https://praseodymiumspike.neocities.org/Snake_in_Ordamirror). The idea of having the entire Battalion be a single monstrous creature is taken from Mad Chess, and some Piece abilities are inspired by the Pieces from that game as well.
## Pieces
### Worm Titan
The Worm Titan is a Titan. It Moves and Captures up to 2 Spaces along Rook Lines, and its abilities may be temporarily augmented based on the Movements of other Pieces; this is described in the subsections about those Pieces. The Worm Titan can Move or Capture through but not into Check. Worm Titans are Immutable.

The Boundless: The Worm Titan cannot visit or pass through a Space it has already been on or passed through previously at any point in the game. Spaces it has visited or passed through should be marked somehow to remind Players that it cannot enter those Spaces again.

The Looming: The Turn of a Player Controlling a Worm Titan has an extra Phase at the end called the Encroachment Phase. During a Player's Encroachment Phase, each Worm Titan controlled by that Player must Move or Capture, and Worm Titans may use the ability The Nightmarish, which is described below. Worm Titans cannot act outside of an Encroachment Phase. If a Player Controlling a Worm Titan completes the regular Phase of their Turn but is then unable to then complete the Encroachment Phase of their turn, that Player loses instantly! In addition, the ability to Pass a Turn does not allow a Player to pass an Encroachment Phase. They would be able to Pass the rest of their Turn, but they would still have to complete their Encroachment Phase, which would then take up their entire Turn.

The Nightmarish: A Worm Titan may only use this ability if it did not use it during any of the 9 preceding Turns. Immediately after a Worm Titan Moves or Captures, the Worm Titan can create a Friendly Leg on a Space Adjacent to its Lair; note that a Space is not considered Adjacent to itself unless an external rule makes it so. The Leg is created during the same Encroachment Phase in which the Worm Titan Moved or Captured and before any other action is taken. The location of a Worm Titan's Lair is described in the section on the Starting Territory.
### Claw
The Claw Moves and Captures 1 Space Forwards or Sideways along Rook Lines. It can also Move without Capturing or Leaping 2 Spaces Forwards along a Rook Line if the intervening Space is empty.

En Passant: A Claw can be Captured *en passant* as if it were a Medieval Pawn whenever it Moves 2 Spaces using the ability described above.

Promotion: A Claw that reaches the back Rank of an Opponent's Territory may Promote to a Talon, which is described later. It is not required to Promote.
### Arm
The Arm Moves and Captures up to 4 Spaces along Bishop Lines or 3 Spaces along Bishop Lines followed by 1 Space in an adjacent direction along Rook Lines. It can also Leap without Capturing to Knight Spaces.

If an Arm is used during the regular Phase of a Turn, during an Encroachment Phase of that Turn, a Worm Titan belonging to that Player may Move and Capture 1 Space along Bishop Lines by Moving Without Capturing 1 Space along Rook Lines, turning, and Moving or Capturing 1 Space along Rook Lines. During this process, the Worm Titan is considered to pass through the intermediate Space, which is important due to its ability The Boundless. Of course, this does not replace the Worm Titan's regular ability; it retains the ability to only go 1 Space along Rook Lines.

* could Move or Capture to Spaces labeled "s" without Leaping
* could Move or Capture to Spaces labeled "x" without Leaping
* could Move or Capture to Spaces labeled "y" through an adjacent Space labeled "x", which it could not Leap to
* could Leap without Capturing to Spaces labeled "t"
### Wing
The Wing Moves and Captures up to 4 Spaces along Rook Lines or 3 Spaces along Rook Lines followed by 1 Space in an adjacent direction along Bishop Lines. It can also Leap without Capturing to Knight Spaces.

If a Wing is used during the regular Phase of a Turn, during an Encroachment Phase of that Turn, a Worm Titan belonging to that Player may Move and Capture an unlimited number of Spaces along Rook Lines. During this process, the Worm Titan is considered to pass through any intermediate Spaces, which is important due to its ability The Boundless.

* could Move or Capture to Spaces labeled "x" without Leaping
* could Move or Capture to Spaces labeled "y" through an adjacent Space labeled "x", which it could not Leap to
* could Leap without Capturing to Spaces labeled "t"
### Talon
The Talon combines the abilities of the Arm and the Wing. If a Talon is used, this affects a Worm Titan as if both an Arm and a Wing were used that turn.

* could Move or Capture to Spaces labeled "s" without Leaping
* could Move or Capture to Spaces labeled "x" without Leaping
* could Move or Capture to Spaces labeled "y" through an adjacent Space labeled "x", which it could not Leap to
* could Leap without Capturing to Spaces labeled "t"
### Leg
The Leg Moves or Captures like a dabbabarider; this means that it Moves or Captures along Rook Lines but only to Spaces of the same color as its current Space and that when doing so, it may Leap Over Any Pieces on Spaces of a color different to the color of its current Space. In addition to being able to act as a dabbabarider, the Leg can also Leap without Capturing to Knight Spaces.

* could use unique movement ability in directions of Spaces labeled "x"
* could Leap without Capturing to Spaces labeled "t"
## Starting Territory
![Starting Territory](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428c8dca-114d-4cbe-9b5f-7137d0925c1b)
A Worm Titan's Lair is the Space it begins on during Territory Placement, the original Space it was on.
