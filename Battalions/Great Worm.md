# Great Worm
## Preface
This is adapted from an still-untested Ordamirror variant that I made a while ago which can be found [here](https://praseodymiumspike.neocities.org/Snake_in_Ordamirror). The idea of having the entire Battalion be a single monstrous creature is taken from Mad Chess, and some Piece abilities are inspired by the Pieces from that game as well.
## Pieces
### Worm Titan
Titan, Immutable, Moves and Captures an unlimited number of Spaces along Rook Lines, can Move or Capture through but not into Check, has properties listed below

The Boundless: cannot visit or pass through a Square it has already been on or passed through previously at any point in the game

The Looming: must Move or Capture as an additional mandatory action that occurs at the end of its Controller's Turn, cannot Move or Capture otherwise, causes the Player controlling it to lose instantly if the mandatory action is not possible

The Contemptuous: begins the game with 0 Contempt, increases its Contempt by 1 each time it takes its mandatory action to a maximum of 9, is not allowed to take actions that would leave it with a negative amount of Contempt

The Nightmarish: designates the Space it starts on as a Lair during Territory Placement, can spend 9 of its Contempt as a regular Turn before its mandatory action that Turn in order to create a Friendly Leg on a Space adjacent to a Lair in its Controller's Territory

The Devouring: as a regular Turn before its mandatory action that Turn, can Capture a Piece on a diagonally Adjacent Space without going to that Space, setting its own Contempt to 0 regardless of what its Contempt was before
