# The Party
## Preface
This Battalion is a work in progress. It is based on the video game _Ataxx_ by Leland Corporation. The most important Piece from this perspective is the Supporter. This is the Piece Type whose mechanics actually mirror _Ataxx_. I have no idea if this is going to work well as a mechanic or not. We will have to see. The Piece Type names are based on a vague stereotype of a first-world or second-world political party or a faction within such a party. The ideology is ambiguous, but the party does not shy away from coercion.

This shouldn't be the final page for this Battalion, either. This is just temporary. Roland will hopefully make a document for it if this idea goes anywhere.

I would like to give a special thanks to churrumais7172 on Discord for helping test this Battalion and giving good suggestions which improved it!
## Pieces
### Supporter
The Supporter and its mechanics are be described here. Some of the rules surrounding the Supporter are listed below. Note that in some ways, the Supporter acts like a property of a Space on the Board instead of like an actual Piece.
#### Basic Information
1. The Supporter may Move but not Capture to another Space within 2 of the Space it's on, and it cannot move to a Space occupied by another non-Haunted nonâ€“Cultist-Hex Piece. It is not impeded by Any Pieces in the way. If there is a Haunted or Hex on the Space a Supporter moves to, this does not result in the Haunted or Hex Capturing itself; they share that Space.
2. Supporters don't count as Pieces for determining groups for _w&#233;iq&#237;_-style Capture.
3. A Player using The Party loses if they have no Supporters on the Board.

* could Move to Spaces labeled "m"

#### General Interactions
1. The Supporter is Immutable, and, with a few exceptions specified in this file, its presence on a Space neither affects the Movement of Any Pieces onto or through that Space nor prevents Pieces from being dropped onto that space. It is a bit like the Haunted in this sense.
2. If Any Piece&#2014;except a Piece that doesn't block movement like a Haunted&#2014; ends its movement on or is placed on the Board on the same Space as Any Supporter, that Supporter Captures itself. This is the only way Any Supporter may be Captured.
3. If Any Supporter Moves to a Space within 1 of the Space it was on previously, it creates a new Supporter on the Space it left, and the new Supporter is friendly to the Supporter that moved. This only applies when Supporters Move on the Board, not when they are placed on the Board from elsewhere. 
#### Interaction with Other Supporters
Supporters may not Move to Spaces occupied by other Supporters, and Supporters which are Reinforcements may not be placed on Spaces occupied by other Supporters. If a Supporter Moves from a Space on the Board to a Space adjacent to an Enemy Supporter, that Enemy Supporter switches sides to match the Supporter that Moved. Only Supporters' own movements on the Board trigger this effect; Any Supporters switching sides, being created, or being placed on the Board from elsewhere do not trigger them.
#### Interaction with Haunted and Cultist Hexes
No Supporters directly interact with Haunted, Hexes, or _w&#233;iq&#237;_-style Capture at all. A Haunted or Hex may be placed on a Space already containing Any Supporter. Any Supporter and Any Haunted or Hex may share a Space regardless of if they are Friendly to each other; for example, this may occur when a Haunted or Hex is placed on a Space already containing a Supporter or if a Supporter Moves to&#x2014;or is created or placed on&#x2014;a Space already containing a Haunted or Hex. All Supporters are immune to Capture by loss of Liberties. They do not count as part of Groups and do not count as filling any Group's Liberties. Any Haunted or Hex sharing a Space with Any Supporter generally counts as part of a Group and may count as filling a Liberty.
### Chairman
This Piece is a Titan. It may Move or Capture 1 Space along Queen Lines.

### Paramilitant
The Paramilitant Moves without Capturing 1 Space Forwards or 1 Space sideways along Rook Lines or Captures 1 Space Forwards along Bishop Lines. When it is not on the Battlefield, it does not have the ability described to Move sideways along Rook Lines. It must Promote to Senator, Deputy, or Minister if it reaches its Opponent's Back Rank. It can Capture *en passant* like a Medieval Pawn.

### Senator
The Senator Moves or Captures up to 2 Spaces along Rook Lines or Moves or Captures by Leaping 2 Spaces along Bishop Lines. It may also Move or Capture an unlimited number of Spaces along a Rook Line if the first Space it would encounter when moving along that Rook Line is occupied by a Friendly Supporter.

### Deputy
The Deputy Moves or Captures 1 Space along Bishop Lines or Moves or Captures to Knight Spaces by going 1 Space along a Bishop Line and then 1 Space along a Rook Line like a limited Frost Beasts Spider. When the Player Controlling it does not have a Support Level strictly higher than their Opponent&#x2014;or, in Party Mode, the one of their Opponents with the highest Support Level&#x2014;it loses the ability to Move or Capture to Knight Spaces indicated in the previous sentence, generally reducing it to only Moving or Capturing 1 Space along Bishop Lines.

#### Support Level
A Player's Support Level is the number of Supporters they Control, whether on the Board or as Reinforcements, plus the number of times they've Captured another Player's Deputy.
#### Capture of a Deputy
If a Deputy is Captured by a Player other than the Player Controlling that Deputy, at the end of the Turn during which that Capture took place, the Player who Captured the Deputy must if possible place 1 new Deputy&#x2014;one controlled by the Player whose Deputy was Captured&#x2014;on an empty Space of the Board or a Space of the Board occupied only by Pieces that don't block movement such as Haunted and Supporters. If a Player Captured multiple Deputies controlled by another Player or other Players, new Deputies would accordingly be placed for each one.
### Minister
The Minister Moves or Captures an unlimited number of Spaces along Bishop Lines.

## Beginning of the Game
If at least 1 Player is using The Party as their Battalion, each Player not using The Party as their Battalion gets 2 Supporters as Reinforcements. These Reinforcements can't be placed on the Board before the first Turn of the first Player who is using The Party as their Battalion. These Reinforcements can be placed anywhere within the Territory of the Player Controlling them.
## Additional Note
As should go without saying, 2 Players playing The Perfect Balance Battalion as a team are considered 1 Player for the purposes of these rules.
