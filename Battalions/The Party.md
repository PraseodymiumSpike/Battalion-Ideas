# The Party
## Preface
This Battalion is a work in progress. It is based on the video game _Ataxx_ by Leland Corporation. The most important Piece from this perspective is the Supporter. This is the Piece Type whose mechanics actually mirror _Ataxx_. I have no idea if this is going to work well as a mechanic or not. We will have to see. The Piece Type names are based on a vague stereotype of a first-world or second-world political party or a faction within such a party. The ideology is ambiguous, but the party does not shy away from coercion.

This shouldn't be the final page for this Battalion, either. This is just temporary. Roland will hopefully make a document for it if this idea goes anywhere.
## Pieces
### Supporter
The Supporter and its mechanics are be described here. Some of the rules surrounding the Supporter are listed below. Note that in some ways, the Supporter acts like a property of a Square on the Board instead of like an actual Piece.
#### Basic Information
1. The Supporter may Move but not Capture to another Space within 2 of the Space it's on, and it cannot move to a Space occupied by another non-Haunted nonâ€“Cultist-Hex Piece. It is not impeded by Any Pieces in the way. If there is a Haunted or Hex on the Space a Supporter moves to, this does not result in the Haunted or Hex Capturing itself; they share that Space.
2. Supporters don't count as Pieces for determining groups for _w&#233;iq&#237;_-style Capture.

* could Move to Spaces labeled "m"
* could Leap without Capturing to Spaces labeled "t"
#### General Interactions
1. The Supporter is Immutable, and, with a few exceptions specified in this file, its presence on a Space neither affects the Movement of Any Pieces onto or through that Space nor prevents Pieces from being dropped onto that space. It is a bit like the Haunted in this sense.
2. If Any Piece other that's neither a Haunted nor a Hex ends its movement on the same Space as Any Supporter, that Supporter Captures itself. This is the only way Any Supporter may be Captured.
3. If Any Supporter Moves to a Space within 1 of the Space it was on previously, it creates a new Supporter on the Space it left, and the new Supporter is friendly to the Supporter that moved. This only applies when Supporters Move on the Board, not when they are placed on the Board from elsewhere. 
#### Interaction with Other Supporters
Supporters may not Move to Spaces occupied by other Supporters, and Supporters which are Full-Depth Reinforcements may not be placed on Spaces occupied by other Supporters. If a Supporter Moves to a Space adjacent to an Enemy Supporter, that Supporter switches sides to match the Supporter that Moved. Only Supporters' own movements trigger this effect; Any Supporters switching sides or being created do not trigger them.
#### Interaction with Haunted and Cultist Hexes
No Supporters directly interact with Haunted, Hexes, or _w&#233;iq&#237;_-style Capture at all. A Haunted or Hex may be placed on a Space already containing Any Supporter. Any Supporter and Any Haunted or Hex may share a Space regardless of if they are Friendly to each other; for example, this may occur when a Haunted or Hex is placed on a Space already containing a Supporter or if a Supporter Moves to&#x2014;or is created or placed on&#x2014;a Space already containing a Haunted or Hex. All Supporters are immune to Capture by loss of Liberties. They do not count as part of Groups and do not count as filling any Player's Liberties. Any Haunted or Hex sharing a Space with Any Supporter generally counts as part of a Group and may count as filling a Liberty.
### Chairman
This Piece is a Titan. It may Move or Capture 1 Space along Queen Lines.

### Chancellor
The Chancellor Moves or Captures an unlimited number of Squares along Rook Lines or Leaps to Knight Squares to Move or Capture. When the Player Controlling it does not Control strictly more Supporters on the Board than their Opponent&#x2014;or, in Party Mode, the one of their Opponents who Controls the most Supporters&#x2014;it loses the ability to Capture indicated in the previous sentence.

#### Capture of a Chancellor
If a Chancellor is Captured by a Player other than the Player Controlling that Chancellor, the Player who Captured it gains a Chancellor as a Full-depth Reinforcement. Full-depth reinforcements are explained later.
### Paramilitant
The Paramilitant Moves without Capturing up to 2 Spaces Forwards or up to 1 Space sideways along Rook Lines or Captures 1 Space Forwards along Bishop Lines. When it is not on its back 2 Ranks, it loses the ability described to Move more than 1 Space. When it is not on the Battlefield, it loses the ability described to Move sideways along Rook Lines. It must Promote to Senator, Deputy, or Minister if it reaches its Opponent's Back Rank. It can Capture and be Captured *en passant* like a Medieval Pawn.

### Senator
The Senator Moves or Captures 1 Space along Rook Lines or Moves or Captures by Leaping 2 Spaces along a Bishop Line. If it Leaps in that way over a Space containing a Friendly Supporter, it may Leap 2 Spaces along a Bishop Line again in the same Turn even if it previously Captured that Turn. It may continue Leaping in this way regardless of how many Leaps it made previously that Turn. However, it may only Leap a finite number of times in a Turn.

## Full-depth Reinforcements
Certain Pieces from this Battalion may become Full-depth Reinforcements due to game mechanics. Full-depth Reinforcements may be placed in the Territory of the Player Controlling them as a Turn. They may only be placed on an empty Space or a Space occupied only by Pieces that don't block movement such as Haunted, Hexes, Supporters, Whisperers, and Wills o' Wisp.

## Beginning of the Game
If at least 1 Player is using The Party as their Battalion, each Player not using The Party as their Battalion gets 2 Supporters as Full-depth Reinforcements. 2 Players playing The Perfect Balance Battalion as a team are considered 1 Player for the purposes of this rule.
