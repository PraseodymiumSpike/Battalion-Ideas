# The Party
## Preface
This Battalion is a work in progress. It is based on the video game _Ataxx_ by Leland Corporation. The most important Piece from this perspective is the Supporter. This is the Piece Type whose mechanics actually mirror _Ataxx_. I have no idea if this is going to work well as a mechanic or not. We will have to see. The Piece Type names are based on a vague stereotype of a first-world or second-world political party or a faction within such a party. The ideology is ambiguous, but the party does not shy away from coercion.

This shouldn't be the final page for this Battalion, either. This is just temporary. Roland will hopefully make a document for it if this idea goes anywhere.
## Pieces
### Supporter
The Supporter and its mechanics are be described here. Some of the rules surrounding the Supporter are listed below. Note that in some ways, the Supporter acts like a property of a Square on the Board instead of like an actual Piece.
#### Basic Information
1. The Supporter may Move but not Capture to another Space within 2 of the Space it's on, and it cannot move to a Space occupied by another non-Haunted nonâ€“Cultist-Hex Piece. It is not impeded by Any Pieces in the way. If there is a Haunted or Hex on the Space a Supporter moves to, this does not result in the Haunted or Hex Capturing itself; they share that Space.
2. Supporters don't count as Pieces for determining groups for _w&#233;iq&#237;_-style Capture.

* could Move to Spaces labeled "m"
* could Leap without Capturing to Spaces labeled "t"
#### General Interactions
1. The Supporter is Immutable, and its presence on a Space doesn't affect the Movement of Any non-Supporter Pieces onto or through that Space. It is a bit like the Haunted in this sense.
2. If Any Piece other that's neither a Haunted nor a Hex lands on the same Space as Any Supporter, that Supporter Captures itself. This is the only way Any Supporter may be Captured.
3. If Any Supporter moves to a Space within 1 of the Space it was on previously, it creates a new Supporter on the Space it left, and the new Supporter is friendly to the Supporter that moved.
#### Interaction with Enemy Supporters
If a Supporter Moves to a Space adjacent to an Enemy Supporter, that Supporter switches sides to match the Supporter that Moved. Only Supporters' own movements trigger this effect; Any Supporters switching sides or being created do not trigger them.
#### Interaction with Haunted and Cultist Hexes
No Supporters directly interact with Haunted, Hexes, or _w&#233;iq&#237;_-style Capture at all. A Haunted or Hex may be placed on a Space already containing Any Supporter. Any Supporter and Any Haunted or Hex may share a Space regardless of if they are Friendly to each other; for example, this may occur when a Haunted or Hex is placed on a Space already containing a Supporter or if a Supporter Moves to&#x2014;or is created on&#x2014;a Space already containing a Haunted or Hex. All Supporters are immune to Capture by loss of Liberties. They do not count as part of Groups and do not count as filling any Player's Liberties. Any Haunted or Hex sharing a Space with Any Supporter generally counts as part of a Group and may count as filling a Liberty.
### Chairman
This Piece is a Titan. It may Move or Capture 1 Space along Queen Lines.

### Chancellor
The Chancellor Moves or Captures an unlimited number of Squares along Rook Lines or Leaps to Knight Squares to Move or Capture. When the Player Controlling it does not Control strictly more Supporters on the Board than their Opponent&#x2014;or, in Party Mode, the one of their Opponents who Controls the most Supporters&#x2014;it loses the ability to Capture indicated in the previous sentence.

#### Capture of a Chancellor
If a Chancellor is Captured by a Player other than the Player Controlling that Chancellor, the Player who Captured it gains a Chancellor as a Nominated Reinforcement. Nominated Reinforcements may be placed in the Territory of the Player Controlling them as a turn. Outside of Party Mode, they may not be placed when the Player Controlling them is in Check.
### Paramilitant
The Paramilitant Moves or Captures 1 Square Forwards along Bishop Lines. It must Promote to Agent if it reaches its Opponent's Back Rank.

### Agent
The Agent Moves or Captures along Queen Lines but is not blocked by intervening Pieces; instead, it is blocked by empty space. It may only go to a Space if there are no intervening Spaces, or all intervening Spaces are occupied by Any Piece that blocks movement. It is still blocked by the edge of the Board.

#### Diagram of Agent's Ability
Here, there is an Agent on g1. It may Move to c5, g3, h2, f1, or h1. It may Capture on d4. Note that if there were an enemy Piece on c5, it would have a choice to Capture on c5 or Capture on d4, but it could not Capture both enemy Pieces at the same time. By the way, part of the shown position is taken from a Synochess game, but that is not relevant.
