# The Party
## Preface
This Battalion is a work in progress. It is based on the video game _Ataxx_ by Leland Corporation. The most important Piece from this perspective is the Supporter. This is the Piece Type whose mechanics actually mirror _Ataxx_. I have no idea if this is going to work well as a mechanic or not. We will have to see. The Piece Type names are based on a vague stereotype of a first-world or second-world political party. The ideology is ambiguous, but the party does not shy away from coercion.

This shouldn't be the final page for this Battalion, either. This is just temporary. Roland will hopefully make a document for it if this idea goes anywhere.
## Accused Pieces
This Battalion has a mechanic under which some Friendly or Enemy Pieces can be Accussed. Pieces are chosen during Placement to be Accused; this is explained below. Being Accused is an additional property a Friendly or Enemy Piece has in addition to being of the Piece Type that it is. For example, an Eagle that's Accused is still an Eagle.

All Accused Pieces have a special interaction with the Supporter; this interaction is explained below as well. All Accused Pieces remain Accused if they Promote, Demote, switch sides, are Captured and go to Hand, or do anything else as long as that thing doesn't result in their becoming Immutable or their becoming a Titan. If it does result in their becoming Immutable or a Titan, they no longer remain Accused.
## Pieces
### Supporter
The Supporter and its mechanics are be described here. Some of the rules surrounding the Supporter are listed below. Note that in some ways, the Supporter acts like a property of a Square on the Board instead of like an actual Piece.
#### Basic Information
1. The Supporter may Move but not Capture to another Space within 2 of the Space it's on, and it cannot move to a Space occupied by another non-Haunted non–Cultist-Hex Piece. It is not impeded by Any Pieces in the way. If there is a Haunted or Hex on the Space a Supporter moves to, this does not result in the Haunted or Hex Capturing itself; they share that Space.
2. Supporters don't count as Pieces for determining groups for _wéiqí_-style Capture.

#### General Interactions
1. The Supporter is Immutable, and its presence on a Space doesn't affect the Movement of Any non-Supporter Pieces onto that Space. It is a bit like the Haunted in this sense.
2. If Any Piece other that's neither a Haunted nor a Hex lands on the same Space as Any Supporter, that Supporter Captures itself. This is the only way Any Supporter may be Captured.
3. If Any Supporter moves to a Space adjacent to the Space it was on previously, it creates a new Supporter on the Space it left, and the new Supporter is friendly to the Supporter that moved.
#### Interaction with Enemy Supporters
If a Supporter Moves to a Space adjacent to an Enemy Supporter, that Supporter switches sides to match the Supporter that Moved. Only Supporters' own movements trigger this effect; Any Supporters switching sides or being created do not trigger them.
#### Imprisonment
If a Supporter Moves to a Space adjacent to an Enemy Accused Piece while the Accused Piece is not Imprisoned, that Accused Piece becomes Imprisoned, and while Imprisoned, it cannot Move, Capture, give Check, or use any active ability given to it any mechanic. If a Supporter Moves to a Space adjacent to a Friendly Accused Piece while it is Imprisoned, it stops being Imprisoned, though it could become Imprisoned again through the action of an Enemy Supporter. Only Supporters' own movements trigger this effect; Any Supporters switching sides or being created do not trigger them.
#### Interaction with Haunted and Cultist Hexes
No Supporters directly interact with Haunted, Hexes, or _w
&#00e9;
iqí_-style Capture at all. A Haunted or Hex may be placed on a Space already containing Any Supporter. Any Supporter and Any Haunted or Hex may share a Space regardless of if they are Friendly to each other; for example, this may occur when a Haunted or Hex is placed on a Space already containing a Supporter or if a Supporter Moves to—or is created on—a Space already containing a Haunted or Hex. All Supporters are immune to Capture by loss of Liberties. They do not count as part of Groups and do not count as filling any Player's Liberties. Any Haunted or Hex sharing a Space with Any Supporter generally counts as part of a Group and may count as filling a Liberty.
### Chairman
This Piece is a Titan. It may Move or Capture 1 Space along Queen Lines.

### Agent
The Agent may Move without Capturing 1 Square along Queen Lines. If an Agent is within 1 of an Enemy non-Titan non-Immutable non-Accused Piece, it can, as a Turn, Accuse all Enemy non-Titan non-Immutable non-Accused Pieces within 1 of it. Of course, it may not use this ability when Imprisoned.

As can be seen above, the Starting Territory must be placed so that the Battlefield extends 1 Space in both directions away from the portion directly in front of the Starting Territory. This is intended to prevent possible issues caused by odd placement.
## Beginning of the Game
If at least 1 Player is using The Party as their Battalion, after a Player places their Territory, that Player's Opponent must select exactly 2 of that Player's non-Titan non-Immutable non-Accused Pieces to be Accused if possible; the effect of being Accused is explained above. In Party Mode, each Player would have Accused Pieces selected by the Opponent Targeting them.
## Future Possibilities
* changing the Starting Territory and the Agent
* changing Piece names
* making Accused Pieces not function as Supporters
