# The Party
## Preface
This Battalion is a work in progress. It is based on the video game _Ataxx_ by Leland Corporation. The most important Piece from this perspective is the Supporter. This is the Piece Type whose mechanics actually mirror _Ataxx_. I have no idea if this is going to work well as a mechanic or not. We will have to see. The Piece Type names are based on a vague stereotype of a first-world or second-world political party. The ideology is ambiguous, but the party does not shy away from coercion.

This shouldn't be the final document for this Battalion, either. This is just temporary. Roland will hopefully make a proper document for it if this idea goes anywhere.
## Volatile Pieces
This Battalion has a mechanic under which some Friendly or Enemy Pieces can be Volatile. All Supporters are always Volatile, and other Pieces are chosen during placement to be Volatile; this is explained below. Volatility is an additional property a Friendly or Enemy Piece has in addition to being of the Piece Type that it is. For example, an Eagle that's Volatile is still an Eagle.

All Volatile Pieces have a special interaction with the Supporter; this interaction is explained below as well. All Volatile Pieces remain Volatile if they Promote, Demote, switch sides, are Captured and go to Hand, or do anything else as long as that thing doesn't result in their becoming Immutable or their becoming a Titan. If it does result in their becoming Immutable or a Titan, they no longer remain Volatile unless they are now a Supporter for some reason.

For each Volatile Piece, the first time in the game that it changes its position such that the Space that it left is either empty or contains no Pieces other than Haunted or Cultist Hexes, it creates a Supporter on the Space that it just left.
## Pieces
### Supporter
The Supporter and its mechanics are be described here. Some of the rules surrounding the Supporter are listed below. Note that in some ways, the Supporter acts like a property of a Square on the Board instead of like an actual Piece.
#### Basic Information
1. The Supporter may Move but not Capture to another Space within 2 of the Space it's on, and it cannot move to a Space occupied by another non-Haunted non–Cultist-Hex Piece. It is not impeded by Any Pieces in the way. If there is a Haunted or Hex on the Space a Supporter moves to, this does not result in the Haunted or Hex Capturing itself; they share that Space.
2. Supporters don't count as Pieces for determining groups for wéiqí-style Capture.
