# idk what to call this
anti-kings, yay!

see [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/diffobjective.dir/anti-king-chess.html)

also alex made a battalion with this concept a while ago

umm

there arent any battalions based on normal shogi setup except shoguns (potat made one called alchemist or something like that but it didnt really go anywhere)

also shogi starting position has squares that are attacked a lot of times (eg square 5,2) so giving the opponent an antiking would not hurt them too too much

usually giving the opponent extra loss conditions is kind of a problem but hopefully its fine because actually giving anticheck will be kind of hard

also this is philosophically inspired by traveling circus

## the anti titan (not actually a titan)
it will have a real name but idk what to call any of the pieces either

this piece belongs to the opponent

when this piece is not under attack, its owner is in check no matter how many titans they have

capturing it is illegal but it still counts as attacked when another piece is attacking it

it can capture friendly pieces but not enemy pieces (it doesnt give check to friendly titans but if you capture your own last titan you would usually lose)

maybe it should be immutable?

something to consider: "the rule that Kings do not attack Anti-King are the sort of fiddly little rules that get added because they improve play. Neither is strictly necessary, although without the second the Anti-King tends to attach itself to the King and stick on it like a leech."

i dont want to have this rule which means that the titan of this battalion should have a way to either get away from the anti-titan, or to avoid attacking it in some way, an idea is to have them color locked on opposite colors: anti titan is a kirin and the titan is a ferz
