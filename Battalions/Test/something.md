# idk what to call this
anti-kings, yay!

see [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/diffobjective.dir/anti-king-chess.html)

also alex made a battalion with this concept a while ago

umm

there arent any battalions based on normal shogi setup except shoguns (potat made one called alchemist or something like that but it didnt really go anywhere)

also shogi starting position has squares that are attacked a lot of times (eg square 5,2) so giving the opponent an antiking would not hurt them too too much

usually giving the opponent extra loss conditions is kind of a problem but hopefully its fine because actually giving anticheck will be kind of hard

also this is philosophically inspired by traveling circus
## the anti titan (not actually a titan)
it will have a real name but idk what to call any of the pieces either

**this piece belongs to the opponent**

when this piece is not under attack, its owner is in check no matter how many titans they have

capturing it is illegal but it still counts as attacked when another piece is attacking it

it can capture friendly pieces but not enemy pieces (it doesnt give check to friendly titans but if you capture your own last titan you would usually lose)

maybe it should be immutable?

something to consider: "the rule that Kings do not attack Anti-King are the sort of fiddly little rules that get added because they improve play. Neither is strictly necessary, although without the second the Anti-King tends to attach itself to the King and stick on it like a leech."

i dont want to have this rule which means that the titan of this battalion should have a way to either get away from the anti-titan, or to avoid attacking it in some way, an idea is to have them color locked on opposite colors: anti titan is a kirin and the titan is a ferz
## more pieces
### cooks
(would not actually be called cooks)

i liked the cooks from artistic battalion so i might want to use them again

basically a cook is a chess pawn, but it captures without moving (rifle capture), and it has the weakness that capturing using a cook prevents ANY allied cook from capturing the next turn (basically, you can never have 2 consecutive turns that you capture something with a cook in both of them)

this is interesting in this battalion because it is a piece that temporarily loses the ability to capture, making cooks a potential source of anticheck if cooks are the only thing attacking the antititan

(the rifle capture therefore isnt necessary but ehh)

might be a good idea for more pieces to be able to lose the ability to capture
### shadow
based on mimic monster from alex's void control alliance unit

might move/capture like a wildebeest (knight-camel compound) but its "ability" is more important than moveset

whenever an opponent piece moves, it moves in the same way (non capturing) if possible, eg if an opponent piece goes from a3 to b4 and its on g2, it would go to h3 assuming h3 was empty

this gives the opponent some control over your pieces and therefore which squares you are attacking, which allows them to make it so their antitan is attacked

3 leaper is not an issue due to oppoenents partial control of piece location

can solo mate a bare king (technically basically any piece could mate by attacking a titan and simultaneously unattacking an anti titan, but this piece can mate without un attacking an anti-titan)
