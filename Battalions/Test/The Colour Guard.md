# The Colour Guard (WIP)
This is a Battalion focusing on Pieces that act differently on different Spaces depending on the parity of the Space; on a chessboard, this would be the color of a square. It's partially inspired by Mad Chess's Tikis.
## Flag Titan
It Moves or Captures 1 Space along Rook Lines or Leaps to Knight Spaces to Move or Capture. 
## Fanorona Piece
disclaimer: This Battalion is not meant in the slightest to be "the Titan's Battalion version of fanorona", not even to the extent to which Frost Beasts is meant to be "the Titan's Battalion version of international draughts" or "The Titan's Battalion version of _w&#233;iq&#237;_".
