# The Color Guard
This is a Battalion focusing on Pieces that act differently on different Spaces depending on the parity of the Space; on a chessboard, this would be the color of a square. It's partially inspired by Mad Chess's Tikis.
## Flag Titan
It Moves or Captures 1 Space along Rook Lines or Leaps to Knight Spaces to Move or Capture. 
### Strong Spaces and Weak Spaces
Strong Spaces are those of the same parity as the Space the Friendly Flag Titan is on. Weak Spaces are those of a different parity as the Space the Friendly Flag Titan is on. Therefore, normally, whenever the Friendly Flag Titan moves, Strong Spaces become Weak Spaces, and vice versa.

disclaimer: This doesn't account for Boards in which each Space cannot be assigned a Unique Parity
## Fanorona Piece
disclaimer: This Battalion is not meant in the slightest to be "the Titan's Battalion version of fanorona", not even to the extent to which Frost Beasts is meant to be "the Titan's Battalion version of international draughts" or "The Titan's Battalion version of _w&#233;iq&#237;_".

Fanorona Pieces act exactly like pieces from fanorona, so it might be best to see the rules of that game rather than reading them here. Strong Spaces act like those reached by orthogonal and diagonal connections whereas Weak Spaces act like those reached only by orthogonal connections.
