# Snare Pieces
Snare Pieces treat Enemy Titans like a makpong king. Specifically, this means that for each Snare Piece attacking a particular Enemy Titan, with the sole exception of Capturing that specific Snare Piece, that Enemy Titan cannot Move, Capture, or use any other active ability given to it by any mechanic. This means that if a Titan is attacked by 2 Enemy Snare Pieces simultaneously, it would usually be illegal for the Titan to Capture either Snare Piece as that would not Capture the other Snare Piece. And if that is the Player's only Titan, it may even be illegal to Capture 1 of the Enemy Snare Pieces with another Friendly Piece as that would leave the Titan vulnerable to attack by the other Enemy Snare Piece. This does not affect Immutable Titans.

An alternative but mostly equivalent version of the rule is that a Snare Piece can Capture an Enemy Titan as if it was still on the Square it was on at the beginning of the immediately previous Turn of the Controller of the Snare Piece. This is similar to _en passant_, though it applies to the Square the Titan moved from, not any Square it may have moved through. An advantage of this formulation is that it can apply to Immutable Titans.
