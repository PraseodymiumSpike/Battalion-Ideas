# Preface
I'm once again willing to consider this Battalion.

You can see https://discord.com/channels/634298688663191582/1241770811254378578 for context. A screenshot is also provided for those not in the PyChess Players Discord Server, but the screenshot might not be updated.

# Snare Pieces
## Current Rule
This rule does not affect Immutable Titans.

Snare Pieces treat Enemy Titans like a makpong king. Specifically, this means that for each Snare Piece attacking a particular Enemy Titan, with the sole exception of Capturing that specific Snare Piece, it is illegal for that Enemy Titan to Move, Capture, or use any other active ability given to it by any mechanic. This means that if a Titan is attacked by 2 Enemy Snare Pieces simultaneously, it would usually be illegal for the Titan to Capture either Snare Piece as that would not Capture the other Snare Piece. And if that is the Player's only Titan, it may even be illegal to Capture 1 of the Enemy Snare Pieces with another Friendly Piece as that would leave the Titan vulnerable to attack by the other Enemy Snare Piece.

Even though being attacked by a Snare Piece may affect a Titan's ability to Capture, it does not affect a Titan's ability to give Check.
## Alternative Rule Possibility
An alternative but mostly equivalent version of the rules is that a Snare Piece can Capture an Enemy Titan as if it was still on the Square it was on at the beginning of the immediately previous Turn of the Controller of the Snare Piece. This is similar to _en passant_, though it applies to the Square the Titan moved from, not any Square it may have moved through. An advantage of this formulation is that it can apply to Immutable Titans.
# Pieces
## Snare King (_khun_)
This Piece is a Titan. This Piece is a Snare Piece. This Piece may Move or Capture 1 Space along Queen Lines.
## Snare Queen (_met_)
This Piece is a Snare Piece. This Piece may Move or Capture 1 Space along Bishop Lines.
## Snare Bishop (_khon_)
This Piece is a Snare Piece. This Piece may Move or Capture 1 Space along Bishop Lines or 1 Space Forward along a Rook Line.
## Snare Knight (_ma_)
This Piece is a Snare Piece. This Piece may Move or Capture to Knight Squares.
## Snare Rook (_ruea_)
This Piece is a Snare Piece. This Piece may Move or Capture an unlimited number of Spaces along Rook Lines.
## Snare Pawn (_bia_)
This Piece is a Snare Piece. This Piece may Move without Capturing 1 Space Forward along a Rook Line. This Piece may Capture 1 Space Forward along Bishop Lines. This Piece must Promote to Promoted Snare Pawn when it reaches on a Space in the back 3 Ranks of the Opponent's Territory. If it is able to Promote at any other time for any reason, it must do so. This Piece may Capture _en passant_ as if it were a Medieval Pawn.
## Promoted Snare Pawn (_bia-ngai_)
This Piece is a Snare Piece. This Piece may Move or Capture 1 Space along Bishop Lines.
# Additional Rules
1. For the purposes of the rules in this section, both diagonal and orthogonal adjacency count as adjacency.
2. For the purposes of the rules in this section, an Affected Space is a Space either within or adjacent to this Battalion's Territory; an Unaffected Space is a Space that is not an Affected Space. The distinction between Affected Spaces and Unaffected Spaces may be thought of as similar to the distinction between the sides of the River in the context of Xiang Dynasty.
3. Non-Immutable Pieces may not make any diagonal Movements, Capturing or otherwise, to any Affected Spaces unless the starting and ending Spaces of the Movement are adjacent to each other. This rule does not affect Moves or Captures to Unaffected Spaces. Notably, this rule does not affect any Moves or Captures from Affected Spaces to Unaffected Spaces.
4. Pieces whose regular movement abilities are affected by the previous rule gain the ability to Move or Capture 1 Space Forwards along a Rook Line if they did not already have that ability. This ability can only be used to Move or Capture to Affected Spaces. Like the case of the previous rule, the destination of the Move or Capture determines if this rule makes it legal.
