# The Party
## Preface
This is just a test version of the rules. The current normal version is linked in the Discord Server.
## Volatile Pieces
This Battalion has a mechanic under which some Friendly or Enemy Pieces can be Volatile. Pieces are chosen during Placement to be Volatile; this is explained below. Volatility is an additional property a Friendly or Enemy Piece has in addition to being of the Piece Type that it is. For example, an Eagle that's Volatile is still an Eagle.

All Volatile Pieces have a special interaction with the Supporter; this interaction is explained below as well. All Volatile Pieces remain Volatile if they Promote, Demote, switch sides, are Captured and go to Hand, or do anything else as long as that thing doesn't result in their becoming Immutable or their becoming a Titan or a Whip. If it does result in their becoming Immutable, a Titan, or a Whip, they no longer remain Volatile.

For each Piece that is selected to be Volatile during Placement, the first time in the game that it changes its position such that the Space that it left is either empty or contains no Pieces other than Haunted or Cultist Hexes, it creates a Supporter on the Space that it just left.
## Pieces
### Supporter
The Supporter and its mechanics are be described here. Some of the rules surrounding the Supporter are listed below. Note that in some ways, the Supporter acts like a property of a Square on the Board instead of like an actual Piece.
#### Basic Information
1. The Supporter may Move but not Capture to another Space within 2 of the Space it's on, and it cannot move to a Space occupied by another non-Haunted non–Cultist-Hex Piece. It is not impeded by Any Pieces in the way. If there is a Haunted or Hex on the Space a Supporter moves to, this does not result in the Haunted or Hex Capturing itself; they share that Space.
2. Supporters don't count as Pieces for determining groups for _wéiqí_-style Capture.

#### General Interactions
1. The Supporter is Immutable, and its presence on a Space doesn't affect the Movement of Any non-Supporter Pieces onto that Space. It is a bit like the Haunted in this sense.
2. If Any Piece other that's neither a Haunted nor a Hex lands on the same Space as Any Supporter, that Supporter Captures itself. This is the only way Any Supporter may be Captured.
3. If Any Supporter moves to a Space adjacent to the Space it was on previously, it creates a new Supporter on the Space it left, and the new Supporter is friendly to the Supporter that moved.
#### Interaction with Enemy Supporters and Enemy Whips
If an Supporter Moves to a Space adjacent to an Enemy Supporter or Whip, that Supporter or Whip switches sides to match the Supporter that Moved. Only Supporters' own movements trigger these effects; Supporters switching sides or being created do not trigger them.
#### Interaction with All Other Volatile Pieces
If an Enemy Supporter Moves to a Space adjacent to a Volatile Piece while the Volatile Piece is not Imprisoned, that Volatile Piece becomes Imprisoned, and while Imprisoned, it cannot Move, Capture, give Check, or use any active ability given to it any mechanic. If a Friendly Supporter Moves to a Space adjacent to a Volatile Piece while it is Imprisoned, it stops being Imprisoned, though it could become Imprisoned again through the action of an Enemy Supporter. Only Supporters' own movements trigger these effects; Any Supporters switching sides or being created do not trigger them.
#### Interaction with Haunted and Cultist Hexes
No Supporters directly interact with Haunted, Hexes, or _wéiqí_-style Capture at all. A Haunted or Hex may be placed on a Space already containing Any Supporter. Any Supporter and Any Haunted or Hex may share a Space regardless of if they are Friendly to each other; for example, this may occur when a Haunted or Hex is placed on a Space already containing a Supporter or if a Supporter Moves to—or is Dropped as a Reinforcement on—a Space already containing a Haunted or Hex. All Supporters are immune to Capture by loss of Liberties. They do not count as part of Groups and do not count as filling any Player's Liberties. Any Haunted or Hex sharing a Space with Any Supporter generally counts as part of a Group and may count as filling a Liberty.
### Chairman
This Piece is a Titan. It may Move or Capture 1 Space along Queen Lines.

### Whip
The Whip may Move without Capturing 1 Square along Queen Lines. It is immune to being Captured. When Any Whip switches sides, the Player who gained Control of it from that may if possible select 1 non-Immutable non-Titan non-Volatile Piece from those Controlled by the same Player who was Controlling the Whip before it switched sides, and the selected Piece becomes Volatile. Note that as it is selected to be Volatile during Placement but is instead already Volatile, it does not leave a Supporter behind when it moves for the first time.

### Paramilitant
The Paramilitant is a Pawn-class Piece. On each turn, it may either Move without Capturing 1 Space Forwards along Rook Lines or Capture 1 Space Forwards along Bishop Lines. It can Capture _en passant_ as if it were a Medieval Pawn. It must Promote to Agent if it reaches its Opponent's Back Rank.

|x|M|S|W|C|S|M|x|
|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|

As can be seen above, the Starting Territory must be placed so that the Battlefield extends 1 Space in both directions away from the portion directly in front of the Starting Territory. This is intended to prevent possible issues caused by odd placement.
## Beginning of the Game
If at least 1 Player is using The Party as their Battalion, after a Player places their Territory, that Player's Opponent must select exactly 2 of that Player's non-Titan non-Immutable non-Volatile Pieces to be Volatile if possible; Volatility is explained above. In Party Mode, each Player would have Volatile Pieces selected by the Opponent Targeting them.
## Future Possibilities
* changing the Starting Territory and the Whip
* changing how Volatile Pieces are chosen
* re-adding Four Winds special interaction: If a Turncoat or Supporter is on the Xiang Dynasty side of a River, it does not switch sides from an Enemy Supporter landing diagonally Adjacent to it. The Square the Supporter lands on would need to be orthogonally Adjacent for the effect to occur.
