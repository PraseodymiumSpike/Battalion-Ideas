"For eons, she just watched.

"It never made sense how the lesser beings fought over trifles and trinkets&#x2014;they always lost more than they gained. So much more. They invented honor, courage, revenge, sacrifice&#x2014;the list went on and on&#x2014;to balance the books. To feel victorious despite their suffering. To make comfort sound worse than misery.

"She knew she couldn't convince them. They worshipped it now. Even their games were facsimiles of it. Even in play, they couldn't escape war.

"It was already too late for so many when she decided to help them whether they liked it or not. But, using the power of their Titan, the rest would be saved. To get them to their new home, she would have to stoop to their level for a bit, sure, but for once, the conflict would be worth it. After this, they would not be able to run back into their cage. Maybe they would eventually realize their causes weren't worth fighting for in the first place.

"And so she molded her essence into a contingent of Stitches, entities that could temporarily bring targets into the peaceful plane of existence she had created, and prepared for what was to be the last battle.

"The last battle ever."
## Stitch Mechanics
Most of the Piece Types in this Battalion are Stitches. Stitches have special mechanics regarding Capture. These mechanics are based on Paco &#348;ako.
### Coexistence of a Stitch and and Enemy Piece on a Space
Stitches and Enemy Pieces may end up coexisting on a Space. In this case, any Player may Capture the set of Pieces on that Space&#x2014;assuming all the Pieces there are Capturable&#x2014;regardless of if they would be Capturing Friendly Pieces by doing so. In some cases, some of the Pieces Captured may immediately be returned to the Board; this is explained later.

For the purposes of the rules in this document, a "lone" Stitch is defined as one that has no non-Immutable non-Stitch Enemy Pieces on the same Space as it, and a "lone" non-Stitch is defined as one with no Enemy Stitches on the same Space as it.
