# Preface
This is my continuation of potat5479's Alchemist's Battalion. In a setting of a drop game, its strength is meant to be that its Pieces can wildly change the squares they're attacking, hopefully allowing for interesting tactics, and its weakness is meant to be the requirement that it have no Pieces in hand left after Checkmating, limiting _tsume_ possibilities.  

_Inspired and largely based on Shogi and Shogi variants. The Alchemist Titan, armed with the philosopher’s stone, is capable of transmuting metals to adapt its powerful magical constructs to any situation, while also reviving enemy pieces and bolstering its own._ (potat5479's description)

### Philosopher’s Stone
Most Pieces in this Battalion have a Tier assigned to them; this is used for certain special Abilities. The scale of Tiers is off by roughly a factor of 2 compared to the scale used by Chess Evolved Online Units and janggi pieces. The Tiers are as follows:

|Tier|Piece|
|-|-|
|1|Lead Golem|
|2|Iron Golem|
|3|Silver Golem|
|4|Gold Golem|
|5|Aluminum Golem|
|6|Tungsten Golem|
|7|Radium Golem|

The special abilites referred to earlier are Fusion and Fission. Only Players who control an Alchemist Titan on the Board can use these special Abilities, and the Abilities can only be used on their own Pieces.
#### Fusion  
When 2 Pieces with a Tier are Adjacent to each other, as an action, 1 of those Pieces may Capture itself in order to make the other more powerful. The one that does not Capture itself becomes the Piece with a Tier equal to the sum of the Tiers of the two Fusing Pieces. This is not considered a Promotion.  
        
If a Piece with a Tier is in the last 3 Ranks of an Opponent's Territory, it can be Fused with a Piece in hand instead of another Piece on the Board. In this case, the Piece that was in hand is used up, and the Piece on the Board is changed into the appropriate stronger Piece. This is not considered a Promotion.

Fusion isn't Possible if it would create a Piece with a Tier that no Piece Type has.
#### Fission
A Piece with a Tier may as an action split into 2 pieces for which the sum of their Tiers is equal to the Tier of the Piece that is undergoing Fission. One of the new Pieces replaces the Piece that was split (This is not consiered a Promotion.), and the other is placed on an "empty" Space ("empty" being defined as any Space that a Piece can be dropped on) Adjacent to that Piece. If there is no available "empty" Space, the Fission isn't Possible.  
### Elixir of Life
identical to the drop rule (Jade Spiritomancy) from Shogun’s Battalion
## Homunculus
can Move and Capture at \*

can Move without Capturing at %

Nifu: Outside of Party Mode, any Move which results in 2 or more allied Homunculi being on the same File is Illegal. The Homunculus and the Shogun’s Pawn (or any other Piece with a nifu rule) are considered to be the same Piece for the purposes of this Rule.

can Promote to Gilt Homunculus when moving into, out of, or within the last 3 Ranks of an Opponent's Territory

must promote when moving to the last Rank of an Opponent's Territory
