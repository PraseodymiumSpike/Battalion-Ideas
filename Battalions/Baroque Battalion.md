# Baroque Battalion
## Preface
This is essentially a 1-to-1 copy of the army each side has in _Ultima_ by the late Robert Abbott, described on [The Chess Variant Pages](https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultima.html). Very little on this page is in any way original, so all credit for it should go to Robert Abbott. The Battalion's Name comes from that _Ultima_ is also called "_Baroque Chess_".

Since this document is pretty technical and pedantic in an attempt to make it compatible with all of the things that can occur in Titan's Battalion, it is highly recommended to be familiar with the rules of Ultima before reading this document.

2 Players playing Perfect Balance together count as 1 Player for all the rules in this document.
## Extra-Strength Battalions
I propose that certain Battalions including this one be categorized as "Extra-Strength Battalions". A Battalion that's the full chu shogi army or the non-rebalanced _Djambi_ army would also be in this category. The rules in the remaining paragraphs in this section would apply to these Battalions.

Extra-Strength Battalions may only be selected in Party Mode with the Assassin Gamemode or FFA Gamemode when there are more than 2 Players playing.
### Assassin Gamemode
When Players' Targets are chosen, each Player who picks an Extra-Strength Battalion puts 2 cards in the pile instead of 1 and draws 2 cards instread of 1. Both cards that such a Player draws indicate Targets of that Player. Both of those Targets must be defeated for that Player to win. Neither of a Player's Targets can be themselves, and if there are more than 2 Players not using Crab Battalion, no 2 of a Player's Targets can be the same other Player. If a Player is defeated, and the game doesn't end immediately, they may no longer take any actions in the game, but they can still win the game. Since 2 Players may have the same Player as their target, a game may have 2 winners.
### FFA Gamemode
A Player using an Extra-Strength Battalion would need to defeat 2 other Players to win.
## Pieces
For the purposes of the rules in this section, any Friendly Piece that generally has the ability to be Captured by another Friendly Piece counts as a Capturable Enemy Piece and is counted among "Capturable Enemy Pieces". In addition, any Captures caused by the rules in this section are considered to be caused by the Piece and Player Moving. They are not considered to be a Piece Capturing itself.
### Baroque Titan
This Piece is a Titan. It may Move or Capture 1 Space along Queen Lines.

### Withdrawer
This Piece may make a movement without Capturing by Displacement an unlimited number of Spaces along Queen Lines; if there is a Capturable Enemy Piece adjacent to the Space the Withdrawer started such a movement on but adjacent in the exact opposite direction to the direction the Withdrawer went in, that Enemy Piece is Captured. This Capture is not optional. There is a diagram [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultimapieces.html#with).
### Coordinator
This Piece may make a movement without Capturing by Displacement an unlimited number of Spaces along Queen Lines; when a Coordinator makes such a movement, any Capturable Enemy Pieces on Spaces that have 2 Rook Lines extending from them in perpendicular directions that fulfill the criteria listed are Captured. These Captures are not optional. The critera are:
* 1 of the perpendicular Rook Lines extending from it eventually reaches the destination Space of the Coordinator that just Moved. Pieces in the way should be ignored for the purposes of this criterion.
* The other of the perpendicular Rook Lines extending from it eventually reaches the Space of a Titan that is Friendly to the Coordinator that just Moved. Pieces in the way should be ignored for the purposes of this criterion.

### Baroque Pawn
This Piece may make a movement without Capturing by Displacement an unlimited number of Spaces along Rook Lines; if there is a Capturable Enemy Piece orthogonally adjacent to it when it ends such a movement, and there is a Friendly Piece orthogonally adjacent to that Enemy Piece but adjacent in the exact opposite direction to the direction the Baroque Pawn ended at, the Enemy Piece is Captured. This Capture is not optional. There is a diagram [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultimapieces.html#pinch).
### Long Leaper
This Piece may Move without Capturing an unlimited number of Spaces along Queen Lines. It may Capture by jumping over a Capturable Enemy Piece along any Queen Line and landing on the Space directly after the Piece it Captured. It may then continue Capturing in that same way along that same Queen Line in the direction it's already going in. It may not jump over Any Piece without Capturing that Piece. Each Piece it Captures must have a Space it can land on directly after; it may not Capture by Displacement when landing on that Space. There is a diagram [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultimapieces.html#long).
### Immobilizer
This Piece may Move without Capturing along Queen Lines. Any non-Immutable Enemy Piece adjacent to it may not Move, Capture, give Check, or use any other active ability given to it by any mechanic except as described in the following sentence. Any Capturable Enemy Piece adjacent to it that is not Immutable and not a Titan may Capture itself as a turn. There is a diagram [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultimapieces.html#imm).

If an Immobilizer in adjacent to an Enemy Chameleon, it may not Move, Capture, give Check, or use any other active ability given to it by any mechanic except as described in the following sentence. It may Capture itself as a turn.
### Chameleon
This Piece may do 1 of 2 things:
* It may make a movement without Capturing by Displacement an unlimited number of Spaces along Queen Lines.
* It may copy the abilities of 1 Capturable Enemy Piece and use those abilities. This does not include copying the property of being a Titan or copying the ability to Promote.

If the latter option is chosen, the Chameleon must Capture at least the Piece it's copying, it must Capture that Piece using that Piece's own abilities, and any other Pieces the Chameleon Captures using the ability it copied must be of the same Piece Type and belong to the same Player as the Piece whose abilities it copied.
#### Side-Effect Rule
This rule is not likely to be very important outside of the mirror match, in which case this rule should make the Chameleon act essentially as it does in Ultima, so you can probably skip reading this rule. However, it's here to help with rulings.

When a Chameleon acts in either of the 2 ways described above, each Capturable Enemy Piece "_x_" that fulfills the following critera are Captured:
* "_x_" is not Immutable.
* "_x_" is not a Chameleon.
* Pieces of the same Piece Type as "_x_" can Capture Pieces as a non-optional side effect of some action that they can normally take. Withdrawers, Coordinators, and Baroque Pawns would fulfill this criterion. As an additional example, if a *tenjiku sho&#773;gi* Fire Demon were added to Titan's Battalion, it would also fulfill this criterion due to its power to burn Pieces.
* There is a normal situation in which a Piece of the same Piece Type as "_x_" could take the exact path the Chameleon just took from the Chameleon's starting Space to its ending Space. A path only takes into account the Spaces moved through, the number of times each of those Spaces was moved through, and the order they were moved through. It does not take into account Any Pieces may have been on the path before the Chameleon took the path. Here, a "normal situation" should be taken to be a situation where the Piece is not modified by any outside effects such as being defended by a Relay Piece or being Blessed by an Apostle. However, a Piece Capturing counts as a "normal situation". For example, there is a normal situation in which a Medieval Pawn could make a movement 1 Space along a Bishop Line; this goes for any of the 4 Bishop Lines, even those that are Backward, as a hypothetical Medieval Pawn could belong to an Opponent in a normal situation.
* In the hypothetical case that the Chameleon belonged to the same Player that it actually belonged to but was of the Piece Type that "_x_" is a member of instead of being a Chameleon, and it as a Piece of the same Piece Type as "_x_" took the same path that the Chameleon actually did, it as a Piece of the same Piece type as "_x_" would in some normal situation Capture "_x_" as a non-optional side effect of taking that path.

## Potential Version for 2-Player Matches
In a 2-Player Match, perhaps, it would work if the following changes were made:
* Baroque Battalion's Starting Territory does not include Chameleons; the Spaces they would start on normally start empty instead.
* The Player whose Opponent is using Baroque Battalion gets 2 Chameleons as Instant Reinforcements. Instant Reinforcements are exactly like Backline Reinforcements except that they can be placed on the Back Rank as part of Territory Placement.
* Chameleons are massively simplified. They may only Capture Baroque Battalion Pieces, and they interact with Enemy Baroque Battalion Pieces exactly as Chameleons in _Ultima_ interact with Enemy Pieces. They don't have any other special interactions with Friendly Pieces at all. They are basically just Chameleons from _Ultima_ without the complexity in [the Chameleon section earlier in this document](https://github.com/PraseodymiumSpike/Battalion-Ideas/blob/main/Battalions/Baroque%20Battalion.md#chameleon).

This version of Baroque Battalion wouldn't be an Extra-Strength Battalion as that label has no meaning in this context.
