# Baroque Battalion (WIP)
## Preface
This is essentially a 1-to-1 copy of the army each side has in _Ultima_ by the late Robert Abbott, described on [The Chess Variant Pages](https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultima.html). Very little on this page is in any way original, so all credit for it should go to Robert Abbott. The Battalion's Name comes from that _Ultima_ is also called '_Baroque Chess_'.
## Extra-Strength Battalions
I propose that certain Battalions including this one be categorized as "Extra-Strength Battalions". A Battalion that's the full chu shogi army or the non-rebalanced _Djambi_ army would also be in this category. The rules in the remaining paragraphs in this section would apply to these Battalions.

Extra-Strength Battalions may only be selected in Party Mode when there are more than 2 Players playing. 2 Players playing Perfect Balance together would count as 1 Player for this.

When Players' Targets are chosen, each Player who picks an Extra-Strength Battalion puts 2 cards in the pile instead of 1 and draws 2 cards instread of 1. Both cards that such a Player draws indicate Targets of that Player. Both of those Targets must be defeated for that Player to win. Neither of a Player's Targets can be themselves, and no 2 of a Player's Targets can be the same other Player. If a Player is defeated, and the game doesn't end immediately, they may no longer take any actions in the game, but they can still win the game.

Since 2 Players may have the same Player as their target, a game may have 2 winners.
## Pieces
For the purposes of the rules in this section, any Friendly Piece that generally has the ability to be Captured by another Friendly Piece counts as a Capturable Enemy Piece and is counted among "Capturable Enemy Pieces". In addition, any Captures caused by the rules in this section are considered to be caused by the Piece and Player Moving. They are not considered to be a Piece Capturing itself.
### Baroque Titan
This Piece is a Titan. It may Move or Capture 1 Space along Queen Lines.

### Withdrawer
This Piece may make a movement without Capturing by Displacement an unlimited number of Spaces along Queen Lines; if there is a Capturable Enemy Piece adjacent to the Space the Withdrawer started such a movement on but adjacent in the exact opposite direction to the direction the Withdrawer went in, that Piece is Captured. This Capture is not optional. There is a diagram [here](https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/ultwith.gif).
### Coordinator
This Piece may make a movement without Capturing by Displacement an unlimited number of Spaces along Queen Lines; when a Coordinator makes such a movement, any Capturable Enemy Pieces on Spaces that have 2 Rook Lines extending from them in perpendicular directions that fulfill the following criteria are Captured; these Captures are not optional. The critera are:
* 1 of the perpendicular Rook Lines extending from it eventually reaches the destination Space of the Coordinator that just Moved. Pieces in the way should be ignored when checking this criterion.
* The other of the perpendicular Rook Lines extending from it eventually reaches the Space of a Baroque Titan that is Friendly to the Coordinator that just Moved. Pieces in the way should be ignored when checking this criterion.
