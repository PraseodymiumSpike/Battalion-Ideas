# Great Worm
## Preface
This is adapted from an still-untested Ordamirror variant that I made a while ago which can be found [here]([url](https://praseodymiumspike.neocities.org/Snake_in_Ordamirror)). However, it is so different from that variant that I think it's reasonable to have it be my "brand-new" Battalion for this event. The idea of having the entire Battalion be a single monstrous creature is taken from Mad Chess.

## Special Ability
A Lair is a Square that a Worm Titan starts the game on. When a Player moves their Worm Titan, they can additionally create a Friendly Leg on an empty Square adjacent to a Lair in their Territory. Here, "empty" should be taken to mean a Square on which it would be legal to drop a Piece from Hand. This ability can only be used if the Player using it didn't use it on any of their last 9 Turns or if they didn't ever use it in the game yet. The Leg is added to the Board immediately after the Worm Titan Moves or Captures. It is the Player creating it's choice whether it is a Right Leg or a Left Leg.
